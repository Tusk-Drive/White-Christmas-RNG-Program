# White-Christmas-RNG-Program
I had written this program, to organize a white Elephant holiday party game.
It takes a random set of numbers from, 1 to 13 and then displays them after hitting the R key. 
Once you are finished, you can hit any other key than R to exit the program. 
You can also modify the program to become a dice roller program, by changing the range of numbers.
